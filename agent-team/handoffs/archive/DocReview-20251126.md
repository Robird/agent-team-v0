# Documentation Review – 2025-11-26

| File | Issue | Severity | Fix Idea | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| agent-team/handoffs/ALIGN-20251126-Plan.md | Workstream 1’s "Required source/test files" call out `src/TextBuffer/TextBuffer/PieceTreeModel*.cs` files that do not exist; all of those PieceTree sources live under `src/TextBuffer/Core/`. | Medium | Update the table to reference `src/TextBuffer/Core/PieceTreeModel.Search.cs`, `PieceTreeModel.Edit.cs`, `PieceTreeModel.cs`, and `PieceTreeSearchCache.cs` so porters can find the right files. | Resolved – paths updated 2025-11-26 |
| agent-team/handoffs/ALIGN-20251126-Plan.md | Workstream 2 groups `TextPosition.cs` under `src/TextBuffer/Core/`, but the file is actually `src/TextBuffer/TextPosition.cs`, so the helper scope is mis-stated. | Low | Clarify the path in the Required source/test files line so the plan points at the real location of `TextPosition.cs`. | Resolved – TextPosition path corrected 2025-11-26 |
| agent-team/handoffs/ALIGN-20251126-Plan.md | Workstream 4 cites `ts/src/vs/editor/common/controller/cursorCommon.ts`, yet there is no `common/controller` directory; `cursorCommon.ts` sits at `ts/src/vs/editor/common/cursorCommon.ts`. | Medium | Fix the TS reference list to use the real path (`ts/src/vs/editor/common/cursorCommon.ts`) and keep the other cursor files under `ts/src/vs/editor/common/cursor/`. | Resolved – cursorCommon reference fixed 2025-11-26 |
| agent-team/handoffs/ALIGN-20251126-Plan.md | Workstream 5’s TS reference list mentions `vs/editor/common/diff/lineSequence.ts` (and omits the leading `ts/src/`), but the file lives at `ts/src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/lineSequence.ts`. | Low | Point the reference at `ts/src/vs/editor/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer/lineSequence.ts` (and include the `ts/src/` prefix for the other `vs/editor/...` entries) so people can reach the right diff helpers. | Resolved – TS diff refs normalized 2025-11-26 |
| agent-team/handoffs/INV-TestBacklog-Prioritization.md | The Diff backlog section points to `ts/src/vs/editor/test/common/diff/defaultLinesDiffComputer.test.ts`, but the test file is actually under `ts/src/vs/editor/test/node/diffing/defaultLinesDiffComputer.test.ts`. | Medium | Update the reference to the `test/node/diffing` location so QA pulls fixtures from the folder that exists in this repo. | Resolved – test path updated 2025-11-26 |
