# OI-011 Result — AA4 Changefeed Delta Published

## Summary
- **Delta Anchor:** `agent-team/indexes/README.md#delta-2025-11-21`
- **Tasks Covered:** AA4-005 (CL5: Builder/Factory parity), AA4-006 (CL6: ChangeBuffer/CRLF/large edits)
- **QA Baseline:** `agent-team/handoffs/AA4-009-QA.md` — `dotnet test` baseline: **105/105** passed.
- **Action:** Published changefeed delta, updated migration log rows (AA4-005/AA4-006) to mark Changefeed Entry = Y and pointed them to the delta; updated Task Board to set AA4-005/AA4-006/AA4-009 to Done.

## Migration Log Entries Updated
- `docs/reports/migration-log.md` — AA4-005: Changefeed Entry set to `Y`; now references `agent-team/indexes/README.md#delta-2025-11-21`.
- `docs/reports/migration-log.md` — AA4-006: added a QA-Verified row (2025-11-21) as Y and added delta reference; the initial Porter rows remain for historical context.

## QA & Validation
- QA artifact: `agent-team/handoffs/AA4-009-QA.md` — `dotnet test src/PieceTree.TextBuffer.Tests/PieceTree.TextBuffer.Tests.csproj` completed with **105/105** tests passed.
- Porter results: `agent-team/handoffs/AA4-006-Result.md` — Final Fix & QA results: `dotnet test` (105/105).
- AA4-005 result: `agent-team/handoffs/AA4-005-Result.md` — `dotnet test` (95/95) validated during the combined run.

## Files & Code Regions Included in the Delta
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer/Core/PieceTreeBuilder.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer/Core/PieceTreeTextBufferFactory.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer/Core/ChunkUtilities.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer/Core/TextMetadataScanner.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer/Core/PieceTreeModel.Edit.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer/Core/PieceTreeModel.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer.Tests/AA005Tests.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer.Tests/PieceTreeModelTests.cs`
- `src/PieceTree.TextBuffer.Tests/CRLFFuzzTests.cs`

## Task Board Updates
- Marked as Done: `AA4-005`, `AA4-006`, `AA4-009`. Pointers added to delta and migration log in `agent-team/task-board.md`.

## Notes & Follow-ups
- `AA4-006` had previously recorded intermediate Porter runs with partial failing tests; this final verification is a QA-verified state with 105/105 tests. The migration log retains prior entries for historical traceability.
- Suggestion: We retained the `Porter` and `QA` historical rows in `docs/reports/migration-log.md` for audit traceability; planners/DocMaintainer can now mark higher-level sprints/AGENTS to reference the new delta.

## Next Steps
1. Notify DocMaintainer and Planner to ingest the delta into AGENTS / Sprint 02 and update agendas accordingly.
2. Suggest DocMaintainer add delta reference to any AGENTS or sprint notes that rely on these regions.
3. Monitor for further CRLF edge-case reports during high-volume fuzz runs; if any new regressions appear, re-open AA4-006 follow-ups.

## Worklog
- **2025-11-21:** Created `#delta-2025-11-21` changefeed entry, updated migration logs and Task Board, created this Result handoff, and confirmed QA baseline (105/105). Info-Indexer worklog updated.
